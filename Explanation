In this customer segmentation analysis project for an e-commerce company, we aim to group customers into distinct segments by analyzing their behavior and purchase patterns. The dataset includes variables such as income, purchase history, and demographic details. Initially, we checked for null values and confirmed the dataset's completeness. Descriptive statistics provided insights into key metrics like average purchase value and frequency. We visualized the income and age distributions with histograms, and a correlation matrix heatmap highlighted relationships between variables. A bar plot revealed the marital status distribution, prompting the creation of a new relationship column to categorize 'married' and 'together' as one group. Standard scaling was applied to normalize the features, and K-means clustering identified optimal customer segments using the elbow method and silhouette score. Post-clustering, visualizations such as box plots illustrated income and relationship characteristics across clusters.
